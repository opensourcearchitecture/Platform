			<p class="centerAlign">Thank you for taking a minute to look through some of my recent projects. The work collected here represents an effort to unpack and re-assemble visual, material, and experiential phenomena. All of the drawings, models, furnishings, and images thereof are explorations in pursuit of a better understanding of the consequences of form. My academic background is in mechanical engineering while my professional experience is in design-build and operations. I am currently pursuing a professional degree in architecture. Please feel free to get in touch. <br>-Mitch</p>
